<div class="textblock"><p >The "files" menu item shows files of the "document" or "resource" directory whose types are known by the application. According to the platform, the document directory is : </p><pre class="fragment">     UNIX    : ~/Documents/&lt;app&gt;
  Windows-10 : C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\&lt;app&gt;
   ( Windows : C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\&lt;app&gt; )
     Android : /sdcard/Android/data/fr.in2p3.lal.&lt;app&gt;
     iOS     : &lt;app dir&gt;/Documents
     docker  : /root/Documents/&lt;app&gt;
</pre> <p >The resource directory comes with an app distribution and its name vary too according to the platform : </p><pre class="fragment">     Linux   : res
     macOS   : Resources
     Windows : res
     Android : files
     iOS     : &lt;app&gt;.app
</pre><p> In general the resource directory contains some "typical" (relative to a given app) data file that permits to test the installation or do demos of an application. </p>
<p >The known file types may be : </p><pre class="fragment">     .fits  : cfitsio files.
     .hdf5  : HDF5 files with g4tools data schema.
     .aida[.gz] : aida files.
     .root  : files at CERN-ROOT format.
     .kumac : GOPAW command files. (Since ioda/1.14.x). 
     .iv  : OpenIventor files. (1.14.x).
     .hiv : OpenIventor files with HEPVis classes. (1.14.x).
     .wrl : VRML (1.14.x).
     .jpg : jpeg files.
     .png : png files.
     .fog : CEA/Saclay povama files describing the LHC/ATLAS
            sub detectors. With the courtesy of L.Chevalier,
            C.Baudry, Marc Virchaux.
     .bsg : binary (inlib) scene graph files. (1.14)
</pre><p> Not all apps know all the upper types. The known file types depend of a given application. See per app doc for that. </p>

iOS</h1>
<p >In general our apps are complient with the Apple document interchange for file types known by the app. Then applications as Dropbox, GoodReader, Mail can "Open in..." a file toward the app. (Strangely it does not work with all file types from Safari. But it seems to be a common problem...) With this feature you can get data files without the need to connect your iOS device to a desktop. </p>
<p >From a Mac, as our apps had been declared as "File Sharing" applications, you can send data files from a Mac on a connected iOS device by : </p><pre class="fragment">      connecting it to a Mac
      launching iTune
      choose the device in the DEVICES list on the left
      choose the "apps" tab in the central panel
      choose the app in the list of "File Sharing" apps
      use the "add..." button to send files on the device
</pre><p> Today (2010) iTune can't send a directory. Something which is needed, for example, to send a FOG directory containing the ATLAS .fog files to ioda. But you can do that by installing and using on your Mac the free "iPhone Explorer" application. After having launched iPhone Explorer on your Mac, drag the wanted directory from the Mac Finder onto the Documents directory of the device seen within the iPhone Explorer tree. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="softinex_app_data_files_android"></a>
Android</h1>
<p >An app should appears as a candidate viewer when choosing a file in Dropbox or from the "Linda Manager" file manager application. (But it is not proposed as a candidate viewer from the "My Files" application on our device under Android 2.1). With this feature you can get data files without the need to connect your device to a desktop. </p>
<p >From a desktop you can nicely "push" files on a connected device by using on your desktop the "adb" tool coming from the Android SDK : </p><pre class="fragment">    &lt;source setup adb&gt;
    adb push &lt;file&gt; /sdcard/Android/data/fr.in2p3.lal.&lt;app&gt;/.
</pre><p> You can use also some free FTP app as the AndFTP one to get data files. </p>
